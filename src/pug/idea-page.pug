                                    p Contemporary South African art is becoming increasingly popular internationally and art lovers and collectors are looking at this growing market.
                                    p The Travelling Art Gallery is a collaborative initiative of South African artists, together with Barbara Lenhard and Florian Gast. Both of them born in Germany are living and working together for nearly ten years in Cape Town, South Africa.
                                    p The initiative is all about showcasing and promoting a collection of established and emerging artists to audiences in various cities: Berlin, Frankfurt and either Munich or Hannover. Each pop-up exhibition will be 8-10 days long.
                                    p This will happen in June/July 2018 - and we aim to travel for six weeks.
